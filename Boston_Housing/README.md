- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

It is recommended to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution which contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `boston_housing.ipynb` notebook file. To complete your work you will also need to use  `visuals.py` and `housing.csv` files which are included. While some code has already been provided to get you started, you will need to implement additional coding to successfully complete the project.

### Run

```jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset used in this project can be loaded with scikit-learn library ([`sklearn.datasets.load_boston`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston)), so you do not need to download it separately.
