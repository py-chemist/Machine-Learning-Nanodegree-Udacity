Also, LG works well with small datasets, doesn't have a lot of parammeters to tune and the training time is fast.\n",

It also has a good bias-variance trade-off meaning that it generalizes data well (better than RF or SVC). Linear SVC is also very fast but the F1 score is lower compare to Logistic Regression. On the other hand, RandomForestClassifier has lower F1 score and it tends to overfit data. In addition, it also 6-7 times slower than Logistic Regression (although for a small dataset it is not a big deal)."

    "Any machine learning(ML) model, in order to predict the future outcome requires data from the past. In our case, we have a list of students with certain caracteristics about each one. For examlpe, age, sex, studytime, health condition .etc. These  are called features. In addition to features, ML also needs to know weights for each feature. You can think of a weight as a degree of importance of a particular feature. For instance, studytime is more importand than sex of a student, that means the weight of studytime will be higher then the weight of sex feature. Do not worry about weights too much,  ML algorithm will automatically calculate them. Having features and weights, the model will use them to find relationship between them and the outcome (in other words, the model maps weighted features to binary answer). This process is called fitting the model(or training the model). After the model is trained, it intakes a list of new features which were not used in the training and predicts the outcome. Since we chose Logistic Regression as our best model, we will use it to predict the students performance.\n",
    "Logistic Regression, unlike Linear Regression which assumes that data comes from a Gaussian distribution and predict numeric(continiuos) values, is a probalistic model based on Bernoulli distribution and predicts a probability of a particular event. Then, the probability is passed to a quantizer function that outputs a binary outcome(0 or 1). In Logistic regression the sigmoid function is used to calculate the probability by the following formula:\n",
    " $$F(z) = \\frac{1} {1+e ^{-z}}$$\n",
